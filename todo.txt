
To do
=====

- Site settings file location makes no sense
- Servant doesn't have to treat global settings and site settings so differently
- Add name of important actions to settings (at least 'read' has to be separated from others)

- Add ServantPages with proper node system and any number of page objects
- Make ServantPage just a shortcut to the current page of SevantPaths
