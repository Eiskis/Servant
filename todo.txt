
To do
=====

- userAction is a silly name (in paths)

- Parse global settings from JSON in ServantSettings (not index.php wrapper)

- Servant doesn't have to treat global settings and site settings so differently

- Add name of important actions to settings (at least 'read' has to be separated from others)
