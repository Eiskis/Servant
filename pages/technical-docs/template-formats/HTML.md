#### File extension: `.html`

All other file formats are converted to HTML, and existing HTML files work as-is. Links and images will be manipulated like with all formats, but other than that, you'll get what you write.

If you're not very familiar with HTML but would like to use it, [HTML Dog's beginner tutorial](http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/) is a great way to get started.
