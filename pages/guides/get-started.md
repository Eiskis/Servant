# Get started with Servant

To create a site, you only need to unzip Servant and **have a text file under `site/pages/`.** Servant will create menus, fancy URLs, sitemaps, stylesheets and everything else.



## Setup

1. [Download Servant](https://github.com/Eiskis/Servant/archive/master.zip)
2. Unzip
3. Move contents on your server

Usually everything works out-of-the-box. You should see the default sample site when you point your browser to where you installed Servant.
