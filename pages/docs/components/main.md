# Main component

Servant's functionality is divided into bite-sized objects. The most important one one of these is **`ServantMain`**.



### Services

When writing dynamic [pages](/guides/pages), [templates](/docs/basics/template-scripting) or [Actions](action), the Main component is available as `$servant`. The following services are avialable for it.
