<div class="faq">

	<div class="column four">
		<h2>What should I use it for?</h2>
		<p>For setting up a simple web site, very fast and without you ending up pulling your hair. Updating Servant sites is easy and pleasant &ndash; not out of reach for even novice users. It's also great for publishing documentation.</p>
		<p>Don't choose complex tools for simple tasks. Next time you start with a framework, ask yourself: "Is this an overkill?" If you feel like saying yes, maybe you should give Servant a try.</p>
	</div><div class="column four">
		<h2>Can I use Bootstrap with it?</h2>
		<p>Yes you can! Actually, a <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> template and a theme with Bootstrap included are included in the download.</p>
		<p>You can also use any other of your favorite tools. For example, the default theme is using <a href="http://eiskis.net/layers/">Layers CSS</a>. Any stylesheet and JavaScript libraries are loaded automatically. And yes, you can use <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, too.</p>
	</div><div class="column four last">
		<h2>Is this a static site generator?</h2>
		<p>Not really. Servant runs on the server and creates pages dynamically. It's not a conversion script that runs upon deployment.</p>
		<p>Although it does some of the same things as generators like <a href="http://www.phrozn.info/en/">Phrozn</a> or <a href="http://bolt80.com/piecrust/">PieCrust</a>, Servant still creates dynamic pages that can be extended with custom backend actions.</p>
