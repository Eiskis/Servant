	<p><big>You only have to add your content. Themes and templates work out-of-the-box: no configuration, no site setup, no deployments. Just download, unzip and move files to server, and update your site by editing your text files.</big></p>
	<p>And if you want, you can create your own templates and themes, add site-specific styling + scripts, write dynamic pages in PHP. Hell, you can even write your own backend actions! Servant has a ton of features, but they don't come in the way when they're not needed.</p>
