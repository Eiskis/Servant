# Documentation

One of my core reasons for writing Servant in the first place was to make publishing and updating documentation very easy with it. Servant excels in this, and its own documentation is thus fairly extensive.

There are things to do in Servant for many people:

1. **Users** install Servant and publish sites with it.
	- Unlike many other systems, Servant does *not* require users to know PHP or any other programming language.
	- The section [Help & tutorials](/help-and-tutorials) is intended solely for users. These instructions guide users through any necessary technical steps when installing Servant or fixing issues.
2. **Theme authors** create new themes for existing templates.
3. **Template authors** write new templates for new kinds of sites.
4. **Action authors** write new backend actions. E.g. the sitemap page and minified stylesheets are coming from actions.
5. **Core contributors** write new features in Servant's core.
