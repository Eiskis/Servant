You do not need to know everything about web development when working with Servant. In fact, you can use Servant just without understanding close to nothing about web development, unlike with many other systems.

We distinguish five groups of people that can work with Servant, and on each step you have to know a little bit more:

1. **Users** install Servant and publish sites with it.
2. **Theme authors** create new themes for existing templates.
3. **Template authors** write new templates for new kinds of sites.
4. **Action authors** write new backend actions. E.g. the sitemap page and minified stylesheets are coming from actions.
5. **Core contributors** write new features in Servant's core.

This means that *you can use Servant without understanding anything about themes or templates*. And you can create themes or templates without understanding anything about how the core system works.
