Themes are folders of CSS and JS files. They can also include assets, like fonts and images.



## Selection process

For each site, one of the available specific themes is selected. Since Servant always attempts to get something meaningful out to the user, it also tries to figure out the best theme to use for each site.

Here's the order of preference used when selecting a theme.

1. <del>Theme defined in site's configuration.</del> <ins>Not implemented yet.</ins>
2. The theme with the same name as the current *site*.
3. The theme with the same name as the current *template*.
4. The default theme defined in global settings.
5. The first theme available.
