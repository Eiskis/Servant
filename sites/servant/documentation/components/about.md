# Components

Servant's functionality is divided into bite-sized components that handle things like article selection logic, path conversions and HTTP headers.

Each component extends the [ServantObject class](/documentation/backend/base-class), which delivers some shared behavior. The components are available as properties of *ServantMain*.
