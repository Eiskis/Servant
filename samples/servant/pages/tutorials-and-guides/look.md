Look
====

Your site's look is defined in *stylesheets* and *scripts*. `CSS`, `LESS`, `SCSS` are supported for styles and `JS` for scripts.

Stylesheet files and scripts are packaged under one directory (`assets/`) where they can be organized freely. Servant will load all supported stylesheets and scripts automatically based on the file structure.

Page-specific styles and scripts under `pages/` will be loaded when needed.
