This is Windows 9. It unifies the previous desktop and RT versions of Windows, taking design cues from Windows Phone that should have been part of Windows 8. Utilizing and building on the Metro style, it simplifies consumer computing experience without sacrificing capabilities.



## Windows

Windows aren't dead. But we can make them more effortless.

Current desktop/window paradigms expect a lot of manual window management from the user. OS X is worse in this regard than Windows, but we can still improve the experience a lot.

- Windows should never overlap.
	- Overlapping windows is never an effective arrangement for any use case.
	- Many windows on one space is confusing as depth is hard to understand and navigate.
- Adjusting window size manually is a way to select use case manually. This is acceptable.
	- On Windows 8, there 
- Frequently closing and opening the same apps/windows should stop
	- This is a ineffective and time consuming user behavior that current window paradigms cater to.
	- Resource management should be handled by the OS (as it is, more than ever, in Windows 8)

On Windows 9, an app can still go to sleep with their windows open. They can choose which parts of the views to update, where and how much to pull data from and so on based on their status. The OS can also indicate the status or activity of a window if needed. Apps should intelligently scale themselves to conform to different levels/frequency of interaction or things like window size.



## Menus & interaction

Windows 8's core features are accessed via hidden menus. Search, system settings, unified sharing, browsing running apps, start and last app hotkeys are all behind menus with **no** affordances. This is also the case for the app bars which house the main controls in modern Windows 8-style apps.

This is a poor design desicion that should not be allowed by design principles. And in fact, is allowed in Windows 9 in only specific instances where the user has explicitly opted for this behavior (e.g. auto-hiding taskbar).

...

Touch input, mouse + keyboard input or other input methods do not necessarily require a fundamentally different user interface structure. For example, while successful touch input requires large hit targets, cursor-based mouse input also benefits from larger hit targets than traditional desktop software provides.

Windows 9 scales up and down to cater to different input methods and device form factors. Windows 9 apps can also make adjustments to their UI based on input methods available to the user. The main OS interface can run in different UI modes with slight variation in window controls, start view and taskbar behavior.



## Simplification

We don't need tiles and excess iconography anymore. While the start experience on Windows Phone is great (on a small device), it's not necessary on larger devices: why use scaled-down representations of apps (tiles), when we have the possibility to use the apps themselves? This exact rationale has been applied in the multitasking view on Windows Phone (screen previews over app icons) - and we can take it further.

We can remove a lot of redundancy that Windows 8 exhibits:

- App shortcuts
	- Desktop space
	- Desktop taskbar
	- Start screen tiles
	- Start screen app list
	- Active apps menu (accessed by swiping from the left or moving cursor to the top left corner)
	- Search results (via search charm)
- App content
	- Desktop windows
	- Fullscreen or pinned apps
- Notifications
	- Lock screen calendar events
	- Lock screen counters (non-interactive)
	- Start experience tiles
	- Notification badges (real-time)
- Status info
	- Desktop taskbar
	- Charms menu status label (time, battery and network connection shown)
	- Settings charm (volume, brightness, network)

Compare this to Windows 9:

- App shortcuts
	- Start view notifications
	- Taskbar
	- All apps list
	- Search results (via start view)
- App content
	- Windows (desktop reel or fullscreen)
- Notifications
	- Start view notifications
		- Counters ("missed" content)
		- Labels (future events or content)
	- Notification badges (real-time)
- Status info
	- Lower-right corner of taskbar/start view



## Start view

Start view includes global search, notifications, status information and settings access, all clearly visible.
