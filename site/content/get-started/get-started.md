# Get started with Servant

Servant enables effortless web publishing. You can get started by creating nothing but text files as your site's pages, but there are also many ways of making more detailed adjustments.

To create a site, **you only need to add a text file under `content/`.** The *template* will create menus, fancy URLs, sitemaps, stylesheets and everything else. Here's where to start learning more:



<div class="column six">
	<h3 class="reset-bottom"><a href="pages">Writing pages</a></h3>
	<p class="squeeze-top">Pages can be written in plain text or other formats. You can also add page-specific styles and behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="column six last">
	<h3 class="reset-bottom"><a href="site-settings">Site settings</a></h3>
	<p class="squeeze-top">Get familiar with all the building blocks that create a site.</p>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>

<div class="column six">
