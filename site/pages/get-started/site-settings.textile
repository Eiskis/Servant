h1. Site settings

Site settings are **completely optional**, but you probably want to manually define some things, like your the name of your page. By adding @settings.json@ in your site's folder you can define these things with a very simple syntax. Here's an example:



h5. @settings.json@

<pre>@"icon": "site/favicon.png",
"language": "en",
"name": "My Awesome Site",
"pageNames": {
	"home": "My Awesome Site",
	"html": "HTML"
}
@</pre>

This format is called _JSON_. Type the name of the property, add a colon and type in the value. Remember to use quotes and separate multiple settings with commas. Some values have children &ndash; <code>{ ... }</code> or <code>[ ... ]</code> are used in this case.



h3. Supported settings

|_. Setting|_. Description|_. Example values|
|*icon*|Path (relative to Servant root) to an image file to use as the icon for your site.|@"site/favicon.png"@|
|*language*|Two-letter language code to mark the main language of your content. This|@"en"@, @"fr"@|
|*name*|||
|*pageNames*|Custom names to use for your pages.||



h2. Name & icon

Your site's name will be generated from its folder name, but you can also choose another name in your site's settings. Templates usually put this name in the site's header and browser's title bar. You can also do the same for page names.

An icon should be a @.png@, @.jpg@ or a @.ico@ file. It's enough to add the path to site settings to get it in use. If you don't choose an icon, the theme's default icon is used.
