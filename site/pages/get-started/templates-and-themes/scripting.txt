For more advanced use cases, PHP templates are supported. They allow you to write dynamic pages, where you can generate content based what's available on your site or environment.



## Examples

#### Dynamic details of current page

	// Print site name on home page, page name on others
	echo '<h1>'.($servant->page()->isHome() ? $servant->site()->name() : $servant->page()->name()).'</h1>'
