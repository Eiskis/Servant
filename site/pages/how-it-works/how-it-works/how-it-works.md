			<p>Servant takes plain text, HTML, Textile and Markdown files, and converts them into web pages. Stock PHP files are also supported for dynamic content, as are HAML and Twig if that's your thing.</p>

	<div class="column four">

		<h2>What should I use it for?</h2>
		<p>Fast, effortless web publishing. Updating content is easy and pleasant &ndash; not out of reach for novice users. It's also great for documentation written in Markdown, for example.</p>
		<p>Don't choose complex tools for simple tasks. Next time you start with a framework, ask yourself: "<em>Is this an overkill</em>?" If you feel like saying yes, maybe you should give Servant a try.</p>

	</div><div class="column four">

		<h2>Can I use Bootstrap with it?</h2>
		<p>Yes you can! Servant loads stylesheet and JavaScript assets automatically, so getting e.g. <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> or <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> into use is just a matter of throwing their files in the theme directory.</p>
		<p>You can even use just the development versions, since Servant will minify and cache all assets anyway.</p>

	</div><div class="column four last">

		<h2>Is this a static site generator?</h2>
		<p>Not really. Servant runs on the server and creates pages dynamically. It's not a conversion script that runs upon deployment.</p>
		<p>It does some of the same things as generators like <a href="http://www.phrozn.info/en/">Phrozn</a> or <a href="http://bolt80.com/piecrust/">PieCrust</a>, but still creates dynamic pages that can be extended with custom backend functionality.</p>
