# Components

Servant's functionality is divided into bite-sized components that handle things like page selection logic, path conversions and HTTP headers.

Each component extends the [ServantObject class](/techincal-docs/backend/base-class), which delivers some shared behavior. The components are available as properties of *ServantMain*.
