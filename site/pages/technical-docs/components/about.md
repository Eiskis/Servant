# Components

Servant's functionality is divided into bite-sized components that deliver settings and services.

All classes in Servant extend the `ServantObject` class, which delivers shared behavior such as value traversing. This base class which includes a set of generic functionality and provides a convention to writing classes.

The components are available under [ServantMain](main).
